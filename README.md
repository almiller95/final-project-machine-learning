## Overview
This project analyzes [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) from Kaggle. First, this project utilized python pandas to clean the data. Then used postgres and AWS to host the cleaned data set. Next, it utilized python pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn to create a machine learning model that will predict if a tumor is benig or malignant based on it's attributes. Finally, this project used Tableau and a Flask app to visualize the findings.
